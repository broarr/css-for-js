Here's a list of things I could have done better based on the solution video:

* I never reset any of the margins set by the browser
* I never set the global font size
* I missed that the font size under "Huckleberry" was larger than the paragraph text
* I relied on the margins and line height to set the section's layout
* My selectors were broader than they needed to be (`.title` vs `.intro-chunk .title`)
* I could have added padding to the `.intro-chunk` instead of relying on text styling
* I could have added padding to the bottom of `main`
* The last paragraph has some extra margin space that isn't needed
* I messed with margins for the `.indented-heading` but I could have been more specific
* I used `strong` selector instead of something more specific


Somethings I did that I like:

* I made the `body`'s background color gray so then the layout doesn't rely on bottom padding of `main`
* I only used negative margin once, but I had to use padding in `.max-width-wrapper`
* I set a better line height
* I added padding to the `.max-width-wrapper`
